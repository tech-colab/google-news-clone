Description: The Formular Page of our Google News clone serves as a static profile input form. We focused on designing visually appealing inputs and buttons to provide users with an engaging and intuitive experience.

Key Features and Functionalities:

    Profile Inputs: We designed a set of input fields to capture user profile information, such as name, email, and bio. Each input field is carefully styled to enhance the overall aesthetic and user experience.
    Buttons: We created visually appealing buttons for actions like submitting the form or canceling the input process. These buttons are designed to be interactive and responsive, providing feedback to the user when clicked or hovered over.

While the Formular Page is currently static, meaning it doesn't have any dynamic functionality or server-side processing, the design sets the foundation for future development and integration of backend logic to handle form submissions.

By focusing on the design of the input fields and buttons, we aim to create a visually pleasing and user-friendly environment for users to enter their profile information.
